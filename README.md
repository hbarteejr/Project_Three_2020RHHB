# Project_Three_2020RHHB

In this project, we are seeking to predict the probability that a player will be picked in the first round from a Power 5 Conference between 2011 and 2020.  

Pro Football Reference and NFL.com data is being used looking at the historical drafts from 2011 to 2020.  Draft Data, including year and athlete name, along with position, college attended and conference of the college are coded for the last 10 years from 2011 to 2020.    

320 Players in total.
320 Total Players were drafted by the 32 teams over the years from 2011 through 2020.  
13 Different Positons were drafted.
71 Different Colleges were attended by the draftees.
12 Different Conferences were represented by the colleges that players drafted attended as student athletes.
