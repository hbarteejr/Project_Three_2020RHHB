# Project_Three_2020RHHB

In this project, we are seeking to predict the probability that a player will be picked in the first round from a Power 5 Conference in the most recent 2020 NFL Draft.  

Pro Football Reference and NFL.com data is being used looking at the historical draft from 2020.  NFL Combine Data, including Year, Player, Position, Age, School, Height, Weight, 40 Yard Dash, Vertical, Bench Reps, Broad Jump, 3 Cone, Shuttle, Round, Team, and School Conference. 

200 Total Players were included in this analysis from the most recent NFL Combine in 2020.    

With COVID-19 prevalent in our society, the purpose of this machine learning project is to predict the accuracy of the round as compared to the final draft position.    

Different technologies will be used that will set forth the approach of predicting the most likely path to the NFL as a 1st Round Draft Pick.
