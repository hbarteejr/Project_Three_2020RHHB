# Project_Three_2020RHHB

In this project, we are seeking to predict the probability that a player will be picked in the first round from a Power 5 Conference between 2009 and 2019.  

Pro Football Reference and NFL.com data is being used looking at the historical drafts and combine results from 2009 to 2019.  Data will also be linked to college statistics of a players who were drafted or appeared at the NFL Combine during those years.  

>>>>>players in total.
>>>>>players that were drafted.
>>>>>that appeared at the NFL combine.
>>>>>players with at least some basic college stats available.
